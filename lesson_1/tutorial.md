The goal of this tutorial is to:

* Get you using a chatbot for common business use cases
* Identify important issues you should keep in mind while using GenAI
* Provide some tips for effective prompting

## Data Security and Privacy

Before we begin, it is **very important** to remember:

* Public chatbots may use data you upload
* You shouldn't upload any data to an AI service without company
  approval, especially:
  * Internal company data
  * Customer data
* Check with your IT department for approved AI services and what data
  is appropriate to upload to them

## Brainstorming and Drafting

TODO

```
Write an agenda for a project planning meeting
```

* ...very verbose, ask to make it shorter!
  * It "remembers" what's been said previously in the chat
* Be specific - what is the project about
* Sometimes good to start thinking with a clean slate, then get a
  second opinion

* Drafting
  * Turn that into a
  * It's quite good at mixing ideas:
    * ...like a pirate

## Automating web searches

TODO

* What tech conferences are coming soon in {city}?
* Look at the sources
* Effectively the same thing as Google's "AI Summary"

## Summarising Documents

TODO

* Summarisation
  * Example csv
    * Re-emphasize data security and privacy
    * Generated with prompt: "Write 100 unique 3-sentence reviews for a washing machine with associated ratings out of 10 in a table"
  * What are the common issues? Don't use code.
    * How can you trust it?
    * Good for a vibe, not reporting?
    * Ask it twice, do you get the same result?
  * How many rows? Mean rating?
    * If it generates code, you can check the code to trust it (if you can read code)
    * If it doesn't generate code, you probably can't trust specific answers

## Generating Images

TODO

* Images
  * Draw your city skyline
    * Spot any mistakes?

## Prompting Tips

TODO

* Art, not science, expect this to change over time as models change
* "You are a..."
* "Step-by-step"
